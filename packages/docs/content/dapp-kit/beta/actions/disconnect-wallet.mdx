title: Disconnect Wallet
---

The `disconnectWallet` action terminates the connection with the currently connected wallet.

<Callout>
	The [Connect Button](../web-components/connect-button) Web Component provides a complete wallet
	connection UI.
</Callout>

## Usage

<Callout>
	The disconnect action clears the connection state locally and attempts to notify the wallet. Even
	if the wallet notification fails, the local state is always cleared to ensure a clean
	disconnection.
</Callout>

```typescript
import { createDAppKit } from '@mysten/dapp-kit-core';

const dAppKit = createDAppKit({
	/* config */
});

await dAppKit.disconnectWallet();
```

## Parameters

None.

## Return Value

Returns a `Promise` that resolves to `void` when the disconnection is complete.

<Callout>
	The action may throw `WalletNotConnectedError` if no wallet is connected. However, wallet-specific
	disconnect failures are logged but don't prevent the local connection state from being cleared.
</Callout>

## Web Components

The disconnect functionality is integrated into the `<mysten-dapp-kit-connect-button>` component.
When a wallet is connected, the button displays the connected account and provides a disconnect
option:

```html
<mysten-dapp-kit-connect-button></mysten-dapp-kit-connect-button>

<script>
	const button = document.querySelector('mysten-dapp-kit-connect-button');
	   button!.instance = dAppKit;
</script>
```

The connect button automatically handles both connection and disconnection states.
