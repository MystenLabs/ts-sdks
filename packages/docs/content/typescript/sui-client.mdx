title: JsonRpcClient
---

<Callout type="warn">
	The Sui JSON RPC API has been deprecated, but is still heavily used across the Sui ecosystem. A new version of the @mysten/sui SDK will be released soon with better support for the [gRPC](./grpc) and [GraphQL](./graphql) APIs. Until this is ready, the `SuiJsonRpcClient` can still be used when working with SDKs that depend on `SuiClient`.

    The [SuiGrpcClient](./grpc) and [SuiGraphQLClient](./graphql) can already be used for most read use-cases and will be fully supported by all Mysten SDKs in the near future.

</Callout>

The Sui TypeScript SDK provides a `SuiJsonRpcClient` class (exported as `SuiClient` for backward
compatibility) to connect to a network's JSON-RPC server.

<Callout type="info">
	Throughout the documentation, you may see references to `SuiClient`. This is an alias for
	`SuiJsonRpcClient` and can be used interchangeably.
</Callout>

## Connecting to a Sui network

To establish a connection to a network, import `SuiJsonRpcClient` from `@mysten/sui/jsonRpc` and
pass the relevant URL to the `url` parameter. The following example establishes a connection to
Devnet and get all `Coin<coin_type>` objects owned by an address.

```typescript
import { SuiJsonRpcClient } from '@mysten/sui/jsonRpc';

// create a client connected to devnet
const client = new SuiJsonRpcClient({
	url: 'https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io:443',
});

// get coins owned by an address
// replace <OWNER_ADDRESS> with actual address in the form of 0x123...
await client.getCoins({
	owner: '<OWNER_ADDRESS>',
});
```

Alternatively, you can use the `SuiClient` alias from `@mysten/sui/client` for backward
compatibility:

```typescript
import { SuiClient } from '@mysten/sui/client';

const client = new SuiClient({
	url: 'https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io:443',
});
```

Network URLs:

- `localnet`: `http://127.0.0.1:9000`
- `devnet`: `https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io:443`
- `testnet`: `https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443`

For local development, you can run `cargo run --bin sui -- start --with-faucet --force-regenesis` to
spin up a local network with a local validator, a Full node, and a faucet server. Refer to
[the Local Network guide](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/local-network) for
more information.

## Manually calling unsupported RPC methods

You can use `SuiJsonRpcClient` to call any RPC method the node you're connecting to exposes. Most
RPC methods are built into `SuiJsonRpcClient`, but you can use `call` to leverage any methods
available in the RPC.

```typescript
import { SuiJsonRpcClient } from '@mysten/sui/jsonRpc';

const client = new SuiJsonRpcClient({
	url: 'https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io:443',
});

// asynchronously call suix_getCommitteeInfo
const committeeInfo = await client.call('suix_getCommitteeInfo', []);
```

For a full list of available RPC methods, see the
[RPC documentation](https://docs.sui.io/references/sui-api).

## Customizing the transport

The `SuiJsonRpcClient` uses a `Transport` class to manage connections to the RPC node. The default
`SuiHTTPTransport` (alias for `JsonRpcHTTPTransport`) makes both JSON RPC requests, as well as
websocket requests for subscriptions. You can construct a custom transport instance if you need to
pass any custom options, such as headers or timeout values.

```typescript
import { SuiJsonRpcClient, JsonRpcHTTPTransport } from '@mysten/sui/jsonRpc';

const client = new SuiJsonRpcClient({
	transport: new JsonRpcHTTPTransport({
		url: 'https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io:443',
		websocket: {
			reconnectTimeout: 1000,
			url: 'wss://fullnode.devnet.sui.io:443',
		},
		rpc: {
			headers: {
				'x-custom-header': 'custom value',
			},
		},
	}),
});
```

## Pagination

`SuiJsonRpcClient` exposes a number of RPC methods that return paginated results. These methods
return a result object with 3 fields:

- data: The list of results for the current page
- nextCursor: a cursor pointing to the next page of results
- hasNextPage: a boolean indicating whether there are more pages of results

Some APIs also accept an `order` option that can be set to either `ascending` or `descending` to
change the order in which the results are returned.

You can pass the `nextCursor` to the `cursor` option of the RPC method to retrieve the next page,
along with a `limit` to specify the page size:

```ts
const page1 = await client.getCheckpoints({
	descendingOrder: false,
	limit: 10,
});

const page2 =
	page1.hasNextPage &&
	(await client.getCheckpoints({
		descendingOrder: false,
		cursor: page1.nextCursor,
		limit: 10,
	}));
```

## Methods

In addition to the RPC methods mentioned above, `SuiJsonRpcClient` also exposes some methods for
working with Transactions.

### `executeTransactionBlock`

```tsx
const tx = new Transaction();

// add transaction data to tx...

const { bytes, signature } = await tx.sign({ client, signer: keypair });

const result = await client.executeTransactionBlock({
	transactionBlock: bytes,
	signature,
	options: {
		showEffects: true,
	},
});
```

#### Arguments

- `transactionBlock` - either a Transaction or BCS serialized transaction data bytes as a Uint8Array
  or as a base-64 encoded string.
- `signature` - A signature, or list of signatures committed to the intent message of the
  transaction data, as a base-64 encoded string.
- `options`:
  - `showBalanceChanges`: Whether to show balance_changes. Default to be False
  - `showEffects`: Whether to show transaction effects. Default to be False
  - `showEvents`: Whether to show transaction events. Default to be False
  - `showInput`: Whether to show transaction input data. Default to be False
  - `showObjectChanges`: Whether to show object_changes. Default to be False
  - `showRawInput`: Whether to show bcs-encoded transaction input data

### `signAndExecuteTransaction`

```tsx
const tx = new Transaction();

// add transaction data to tx...

const result = await client.signAndExecuteTransaction({
	transaction: tx,
	signer: keypair,
	options: {
		showEffects: true,
	},
});
```

#### Arguments

- `transaction` - BCS serialized transaction data bytes as a Uint8Array or as a base-64 encoded
  string.
- `signer` - A `Keypair` instance to sign the transaction
- `options`:
  - `showBalanceChanges`: Whether to show balance_changes. Default to be False
  - `showEffects`: Whether to show transaction effects. Default to be False
  - `showEvents`: Whether to show transaction events. Default to be False
  - `showInput`: Whether to show transaction input data. Default to be False
  - `showObjectChanges`: Whether to show object_changes. Default to be False
  - `showRawInput`: Whether to show bcs-encoded transaction input data

### `waitForTransaction`

Wait for a transaction result to be available over the API. This can be used in conjunction with
`signAndExecuteTransaction` to wait for the transaction to be available via the API. This currently
polls the `getTransactionBlock` API to check for the transaction.

```tsx
const tx = new Transaction();

const result = await client.signAndExecuteTransaction({
	transaction: tx,
	signer: keypair,
});

const transaction = await client.waitForTransaction({
	digest: result.digest,
	options: {
		showEffects: true,
	},
});
```

#### Arguments

- `digest` - the digest of the queried transaction
- `signal` - An optional abort signal that can be used to cancel the request
- `timeout` - The amount of time to wait for a transaction. Defaults to one minute.
- `pollInterval` - The amount of time to wait between checks for the transaction. Defaults to 2
  seconds.
- `options`:
  - `showBalanceChanges`: Whether to show balance_changes. Default to be False
  - `showEffects`: Whether to show transaction effects. Default to be False
  - `showEvents`: Whether to show transaction events. Default to be False
  - `showInput`: Whether to show transaction input data. Default to be False
  - `showObjectChanges`: Whether to show object_changes. Default to be False
  - `showRawInput`: Whether to show bcs-encoded transaction input data
