This guide will help you quickly integrate the dApp Kit into your application.

## Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @mysten/dapp-kit-core @mysten/sui
```

<Callout>
	For **React**, you might prefer to [install React
	bindings](./framework-guides/react/getting-started#installation).
</Callout>

## Basic Usage

Start with [creating a dApp Kit instance](./dapp-kit-instance). You might also want to check our
[Web Components](./web-components/connect-button) or
[React bindings](./framework-guides/react/getting-started#installation).

## Core Concepts

### Framework-Agnostic Core

The `@mysten/dapp-kit-core` package contains all the business logic and state management, as well as
pre-built [Web Components](./web-components/connect-button) that work across all frameworks.

### Reactive State with nanostores

State is managed using nanostores, which are lightweight reactive state containers:

```typescript
// Subscribe to connection changes
dAppKit.stores.$connection.subscribe((connection) => {
	console.log('Connection state:', connection);
});

// Get current value
const currentNetwork = dAppKit.stores.$currentNetwork.get();
```
