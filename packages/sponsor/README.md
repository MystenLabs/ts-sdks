# @mysten-incubation/sponsor

Primitives for building gas-sponsorship flows on Sui. You are the **sponsor operator**: you bring a
`Signer` (the sponsor) and a policy for what you'll pay for, and `createSponsor` takes a user's
transaction, fills in the gas, validates it against that policy, and adds the sponsor's signature.
The hard part — _validating what you're sponsoring_ — is handled by a pluggable pipeline backed by
the [`@mysten/wallet-sdk` transaction analyzer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mysten/wallet-sdk).

The transaction comes from your user; you decide what's allowed and cover the gas.

Full documentation — the recommended flow, validation, and best practices, split into guides — lives
at [sdk.mystenlabs.com/sponsor](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/sponsor).

## Install

```sh
npm install @mysten-incubation/sponsor @mysten/sui
```

## Quick start

```ts
import { SuiGrpcClient } from '@mysten/sui/grpc';
import { Ed25519Keypair } from '@mysten/sui/keypairs/ed25519';
import { createSponsor, defaults, gasBudget, allowedPackages } from '@mysten-incubation/sponsor';

const client = new SuiGrpcClient({
	network: 'testnet',
	baseUrl: 'https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443',
});

const sponsor = createSponsor({
	signer: Ed25519Keypair.fromSecretKey(process.env.SPONSOR_KEY!),
	client,
	// `defaults()` keeps the baseline (see Defaults).
	validate: [defaults(), gasBudget({ max: 50_000_000n }), allowedPackages(['0xabc'])],
});
```

## How gas works

The sponsor pays gas from its **address balance** — the empty gas payment (`setGasPayment([])`)
draws from the sponsor's on-chain SUI balance rather than from specific gas coins. This has two
benefits:

- **The sponsor can sign and execute in parallel.** Address-balance gas doesn't lock specific coin
  objects, so concurrent sponsored transactions don't contend for gas coins. (A _sender_ that reuses
  its own versioned objects — coins — across rapid transactions still has to serialize those, but
  that's the sender's concern, not the sponsor's.)
- **The network sets a bounded expiration.** Resolving address-balance gas makes the fullnode attach
  a short `ValidDuring` expiration (valid through the next epoch), which `boundedExpiration()`
  verifies — so a signed sponsored transaction can't linger.

You fund the address balance by depositing SUI into it (e.g. a one-time
`0x2::coin::send_funds(coin, sponsorAddress)`); the faucet only hands out coin objects, not address
balance.

Because gas is the sponsor's, **a sponsored transaction must never use the gas coin** (`tx.gas`).
`gasCoinNotUsed()` (a default) enforces this — when the user needs SUI, they spend their own with
`tx.coin({ balance, useGasCoin: false })`.

## Defaults

If you pass no `validate`, the sponsor runs `defaults()` — `validSender()`,
`onlyAddressBalanceGas()`, `gasCoinNotUsed()`, `onlySenderWithdrawals()`, `simulationSucceeds()`,
and `boundedExpiration()`. Once you add your own validators they no longer run automatically; drop
them back in as one entry (the `validate` array flattens nested arrays):

```ts
createSponsor({ signer, client }); // runs defaults()
createSponsor({ signer, client, validate: [defaults(), allowedPackages(['0xabc'])] });
```

Each default guards something real: `validSender()` requires a sender and stops a caller from
sponsoring their own transaction; `onlyAddressBalanceGas()` and `gasCoinNotUsed()` stop a caller
from spending the sponsor's gas (its address balance pays, and the gas coin is the sponsor's);
`onlySenderWithdrawals()` rejects any `FundsWithdrawal` input that isn't the sender's — including
one from the sponsor's **address balance** (the same balance that pays gas — a direct drain the
gas-coin check can't see, since the withdrawal is an _input_, not a command argument);
`simulationSucceeds()` avoids paying for a transaction that aborts; and `boundedExpiration()` caps
how long the signed transaction stays valid.

Two things the defaults **don't** do, by design — handle them at your service boundary:

- **No gas ceiling.** A legitimate but expensive transaction can cost up to the protocol max. Add
  `gasBudget({ max })` for a cap, and rate-limit / authenticate callers.
- **No execution guarantee.** `simulationSucceeds()` is a dry-run; on-chain state can shift before
  execution, so a later-aborting sponsored transaction can still charge the sponsor gas.

Keep `defaults()` unless you're deliberately replacing those checks.

For **offline-only signing** — no dry-run — use validators that read only `data` (no
`transactionResponse`). Nothing depends on simulation, so the sponsor never simulates:

```ts
createSponsor({ signer, client, validate: [validSender(), gasCoinNotUsed()] });
```

## What `transaction` is

The sponsor methods take a `transaction` that is anything `Transaction.from` accepts:

```ts
type TransactionInput = Transaction | Uint8Array | string; // a Transaction, built bytes, base64, or JSON
```

When you also pass a `userSignature`, the bytes are already final (the user signed them), so that
form must be the exact bytes — a `Uint8Array` or a base64 string (not a `Transaction` or JSON). The
sponsor never rebuilds them (so the user's signature stays valid). The sender is already part of
those bytes, so there's no `sender` parameter in this flow. `userSignature` may be a single string
or an array (e.g. multiple required signers).

## The primitives

A `Sponsor` has three members:

- **`sponsor.address`** — the sponsor's address.
- **`sponsor.signTransaction({ transaction, sender?, userSignature?, validationOptions? })`** — set
  the gas data (sponsor as gas owner, address-balance gas), build, validate, and add the sponsor's
  signature. Returns `{ $kind: 'Signed', bytes, sponsorSignature, digest, signatures? }`, or
  `{ $kind: 'Rejected', issues, reason }` if a validator declined. `validationOptions` carries any
  request-scoped options your validators read (see
  [Request-scoped options](#request-scoped-options)) — required only when a validator declares a
  required one.
- **`sponsor.signAndExecuteTransaction({ transaction, userSignature, include?, validationOptions?, … })`**
  — `signTransaction` + execute. Returns `{ $kind: 'Rejected', … }` (never executed) or the
  execution result (`{ $kind: 'Transaction', … }` / `{ $kind: 'FailedTransaction', … }`). It
  forwards every other prop the core `executeTransaction` takes (e.g. `signal`). `include` selects
  the **extra** result fields to fetch — `effects` is always included and can't be turned off — and
  the result type reflects exactly what you asked for. The dry-run that backs validation can be
  extended too: a validator declares the simulate `include` fields it needs (e.g.
  `include: { balanceChanges: true }`), and that requirement surfaces, typed, on `validationOptions`
  (see [Request-scoped options](#request-scoped-options)).

Validation rejection is **returned, not thrown** — `switch (result.$kind)` to handle every outcome,
the same way you handle `Transaction` vs `FailedTransaction`. (Genuine errors — network, malformed
input — still throw.)

In the examples below, `userSigner` is the user's `Signer`. In a dApp, the user signs via dapp-kit's
`signTransaction` instead.

### The client builds the transaction (recommended)

Prefer having the client build the transaction so the user can sign before the sponsor does — the
sponsor then knows exactly what it's co-signing, and there's no half-signed transaction waiting on a
user. The client sets the **sender**, the **gas owner to the sponsor**, and the **gas payment to
`[]`** (address-balance gas). The user signs those final bytes, and the sponsor co-signs and
executes:

```ts
transaction.setSender(userAddress);
transaction.setGasOwner(sponsor.address); // gas is paid by the sponsor…
transaction.setGasPayment([]); // …from its address balance (no specific gas coins)
const bytes = await transaction.build({ client });

const { signature: userSignature } = await userSigner.signTransaction(bytes);
const result = await sponsor.signAndExecuteTransaction({ transaction: bytes, userSignature });

// Three outcomes, not two — switch on `$kind`:
switch (result.$kind) {
	case 'Rejected': // a validator declined; the sponsor never signed or executed
		throw new Error(result.issues.map((issue) => issue.message).join('; '));
	case 'FailedTransaction': // executed on-chain but aborted — the sponsor still paid gas
		throw new Error(`Transaction failed on-chain: ${result.FailedTransaction.digest}`);
	case 'Transaction': // executed successfully
		return result.Transaction.digest;
}
```

`signAndExecuteTransaction` has **three** outcomes: a policy `Rejected` (never executed), a
`FailedTransaction` (executed but aborted on-chain — note the sponsor's gas is spent either way),
and a successful `Transaction`. The non-obvious one is `FailedTransaction`: a result that isn't
`Rejected` still isn't necessarily a success. `signTransaction` (no execution) is simpler — just
`Signed` or `Rejected`.

### The sponsor builds the transaction

Alternatively, hand the sponsor the user's commands. The sponsor sets itself as gas owner, builds
(address-balance gas, and — unless you pinned one — a dry-run-estimated budget), validates, and
signs. The user then signs the returned bytes, and both signatures execute together. `sender` is
optional — it's applied only when the transaction doesn't already set one (e.g. bare commands):

```ts
const result = await sponsor.signTransaction({
	transaction,
	sender: userAddress, // optional — only used if `transaction` has no sender
});
if (result.$kind === 'Rejected') {
	throw new Error(result.issues.map((issue) => issue.message).join('; '));
}

const { signature: userSignature } = await userSigner.signTransaction(result.bytes);
await client.core.executeTransaction({
	transaction: result.bytes,
	signatures: [userSignature, result.sponsorSignature],
});
```

### A user transaction

A sponsored transaction operates on the **user's** objects, never the gas coin. When the user spends
SUI, source it from their own balance with `useGasCoin: false`:

```ts
function userPayment(amount: bigint) {
	const tx = new Transaction();
	const coin = tx.coin({ balance: amount, useGasCoin: false });
	tx.transferObjects([coin], recipient);
	return tx;
}
```

## Gas & unresolved transactions

When the sponsor builds the transaction, what you pass to `signTransaction` can be **unresolved** —
unresolved object inputs and no gas budget are fine. The sponsor sets itself as gas owner with
address-balance gas and calls `build({ client })`, which in one pass resolves object inputs, sets
the gas price and expiration, and — unless the transaction already pins one (`tx.setGasBudget(…)`) —
**estimates the gas budget by dry-running**. Validation then runs on the _built_ transaction, so
`gasBudget({ max })` checks the resolved budget and analyzers see the exact bytes that get signed.

(When the client builds, it's the opposite: the user already built and signed final bytes, so they
must be resolved — the sponsor never rebuilds them.)

## Over the network

The methods are transport-agnostic: they take a transaction / bytes / base64 and signature strings,
and return `bytes: Uint8Array` plus signature strings. You own the HTTP shape — serialize binary
fields as base64. With the recommended flow, the client builds and signs, then sends the bytes and
signature; the sponsor validates, co-signs, and executes. Every outcome is a `$kind`, so no
try/catch is needed for a policy rejection:

```ts
import { toBase64 } from '@mysten/sui/utils';

// Server handler — wire it into your framework's route however you like.
async function handleSponsorRequest(body: { transaction: string; userSignature: string }) {
	const result = await sponsor.signAndExecuteTransaction({
		transaction: body.transaction,
		userSignature: body.userSignature,
	});
	switch (result.$kind) {
		case 'Rejected':
			return { ok: false as const, issues: result.issues };
		case 'FailedTransaction':
			return { ok: false as const, issues: [{ message: 'Transaction failed on-chain.' }] };
		case 'Transaction':
			return { ok: true as const, digest: result.Transaction.digest };
	}
}

// Client — build with the sponsor as gas owner, sign, send the bytes + signature.
transaction.setSender(userAddress);
transaction.setGasOwner(sponsor.address);
transaction.setGasPayment([]);
const bytes = await transaction.build({ client });
const { signature } = await userSigner.signTransaction(bytes);

const res = await handleSponsorRequest({ transaction: toBase64(bytes), userSignature: signature });
if (!res.ok) throw new Error(res.issues.map((issue) => issue.message).join('; '));
```

Need per-request context (an auth token, a tenant id)? Validators read it from `options`, and the
sponsor requires it — typed — on `signTransaction`. See
[Request-scoped options](#request-scoped-options). Handle anti-replay / rate limiting in your
service.

## Custom validators

A validator **is an analyzer** — just `createAnalyzer(...)` — whose result is the issues it found.
It declares the analyzers it reads via `dependencies` and reports these outcomes:

- **pass** — `{ result: null }` (or `{ result: [] }`);
- **reject** — `{ result: [{ code, message }] }`: the transaction is well-formed but violates policy
  → `POLICY_REJECTED`;
- **partial** — `{ result: [{ code, message }], issues: [{ message }] }`: the validator found a
  policy rejection but also hit an analysis issue, so sponsor validation reports both and treats the
  overall reason as `ANALYSIS_FAILED`;
- **couldn't analyze** — `{ issues: [{ message }] }` or `throw`: the analyzer itself couldn't decide
  (a failed lookup, an unreachable service) → `ANALYSIS_FAILED`. This is the analyzer framework's
  own channel, so it propagates through strict dependencies. Sponsor validation treats each
  configured validator independently, so one validator's analysis failure doesn't suppress policy
  rejections from other validators.

Reporting findings as the `result` (rather than via `issues`) is what keeps "violates policy"
distinct from "couldn't be checked". There's no built-in "the sponsor must be paid" rule —
value-flow policy is app-specific, so write it over the built-in `balanceFlows` analyzer (signed
per-address deltas: **negative = value left the owner, positive = arrived**):

```ts
import { analyzers, createAnalyzer } from '@mysten-incubation/sponsor';

const requireSponsorPayment = createAnalyzer({
	dependencies: { balanceFlows: analyzers.balanceFlows },
	analyze:
		() =>
		({ balanceFlows }) => {
			const received =
				balanceFlows.sponsor
					?.filter((flow) => flow.coinType === USDC)
					.reduce((sum, flow) => sum + flow.amount, 0n) ?? 0n;

			return received < 10_000n
				? { result: [{ code: 'UNDERPAID', message: `Sponsor received ${received}, needs 10000.` }] }
				: { result: null };
		},
});
```

The most useful built-in analyzer is **`data`** — the parsed transaction (sender, gas data,
commands, expiration), which most validators read. Alongside it: `balanceFlows` (signed value
deltas), `transactionResponse` (the dry-run, incl. effects), `commands`, `moveFunctions`, `objects`,
`coins`, `inputs`, and `bytes` — plus the sponsor's `currentEpoch`, and any others the analyzer
package adds (see [`@mysten/wallet-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mysten/wallet-sdk) for the
full set). All are re-exported as `analyzers` (with `currentEpoch`, `createAnalyzer`, and `optional`
alongside). A failed required analyzer never reaches your validator's `analyze`: that validator
contributes an `ANALYSIS_FAILED` issue while independent validators can still report policy
rejections.

## Loading data, and sharing it across validators

An analyzer receives the same `options` the sponsor passes to `analyze` — including **`client`** —
so it can load on-chain data. And because the framework runs each analyzer once and shares its
result, several validators read it for the cost of one fetch:

```ts
import { analyzers, createAnalyzer } from '@mysten-incubation/sponsor';

// Loads the *sponsor's* SUI balance via options.client (the gas owner is the sponsor)…
const sponsorBalance = createAnalyzer({
	dependencies: { data: analyzers.data },
	analyze:
		(options) =>
		async ({ data }) => {
			const { balance } = await options.client.core.getBalance({ owner: data.gasData.owner ?? '' });
			return { result: BigInt(balance.balance) };
		},
});

// …read by two validators; the `getBalance` call still runs only once.
const sponsorCanCoverGas = createAnalyzer({
	dependencies: { sponsorBalance, data: analyzers.data },
	analyze:
		() =>
		({ sponsorBalance, data }) =>
			sponsorBalance >= BigInt(data.gasData.budget ?? 0)
				? { result: null }
				: {
						result: [{ code: 'SPONSOR_UNDERFUNDED', message: 'Sponsor balance cannot cover gas.' }],
					},
});
const sponsorKeepsReserve = createAnalyzer({
	dependencies: { sponsorBalance },
	analyze:
		() =>
		({ sponsorBalance }) =>
			sponsorBalance >= 1_000_000_000n
				? { result: null }
				: { result: [{ code: 'RESERVE_LOW', message: 'Sponsor reserve below 1 SUI.' }] },
});

createSponsor({ signer, client, validate: [sponsorCanCoverGas, sponsorKeepsReserve] });
```

## Request-scoped options

A validator reads request inputs — an auth token, a tenant id — straight off `options`.
`createSponsor` **infers** them and requires them, typed, under `validationOptions` on
`signTransaction` (required only when the option itself is required) — no opaque metadata bag:

```ts
const authChecked = createAnalyzer({
	analyze: (options: { authToken: string }) => () =>
		isValidToken(options.authToken)
			? { result: null }
			: { result: [{ code: 'BAD_AUTH', message: 'Invalid auth token.' }] },
});

const sponsor = createSponsor({ signer, client, validate: [authChecked] });

// `validationOptions.authToken` is now a required, typed argument:
await sponsor.signAndExecuteTransaction({
	transaction,
	userSignature,
	validationOptions: { authToken },
});
```

## How it runs

`createSponsor` aggregates every validator through **`sponsor.analyzer`**, and validation is just
`analyze({ check: sponsor.analyzer }, { transaction, client })`. The analyzer framework then gives,
for free:

- **Lazy** — only analyzers some validator depends on run, so cost tracks your policy. `defaults()`
  includes `simulationSucceeds`, so the default config _does_ dry-run; drop it (or use only
  validators that read `data`) and the sponsor **never simulates**. There's no "offline phase" to
  declare — it falls out of the dependency graph.
- **Deduped** — `data` / `balanceFlows` etc. resolve once even when many validators (and a host
  graph) depend on them.
- **Independent failure reporting** — a failed validator becomes an `ANALYSIS_FAILED` entry in
  `analysisIssues`, without suppressing policy rejections from validators that did run.

When validation fails, the sponsor never signs and the method **returns**
`{ $kind: 'Rejected', issues, policyIssues, analysisIssues, reason }`. `issues` preserves the
combined list for existing callers, while `policyIssues` and `analysisIssues` separate policy
rejections from checks that could not run. `reason` is `'POLICY_REJECTED'` when every reported issue
is policy-only and `'ANALYSIS_FAILED'` when any check could not run. To turn a rejection into a
thrown error, the exported `SponsorValidationError` class takes `(issues, reason)`.

**`sponsor.analyzer`** is also the composable handle: drop it into any other `analyze()` graph and
it contributes `SponsorRejection | null`, deduping its analyzers with that graph.

## Built-in validators

| Validator                      | Reads                  | Rejects when…                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `validSender()`                | `data`                 | the sender is unset, or is the gas owner (sponsor)        |
| `onlyAddressBalanceGas()`      | `data`                 | the gas payment isn't empty (`[]`)†                       |
| `gasCoinNotUsed()`             | `data`                 | a command uses the gas coin (`tx.gas`)                    |
| `onlySenderWithdrawals()`      | `data`                 | a `FundsWithdrawal` input isn't the sender's              |
| `userSignatureMatchesSender()` | `bytes`, `data`        | a supplied user signature isn't a valid sender signature‡ |
| `gasBudget({ min?, max? })`    | `data`                 | the gas budget is unset or outside the range              |
| `allowedPackages([...])`       | `data`                 | a MoveCall targets a package outside the allowlist        |
| `allowedFunctions([...])`      | `data`                 | a MoveCall targets a function outside the allowlist       |
| `simulationSucceeds()`         | `transactionResponse`  | the dry-run succeeds but the transaction would abort\*    |
| `boundedExpiration()`          | `data`, `currentEpoch` | the expiration is missing or beyond the next epoch        |

\* The dry-run itself _succeeding_ but reporting an aborting transaction is a **policy** rejection
(`TRANSACTION_WOULD_FAIL`) — the bytes are executable and would still cost the sponsor gas (landing
a failed transaction with a digest) if submitted. The dry-run _failing to run at all_ (an
unreachable node, unresolvable objects) is instead surfaced as `ANALYSIS_FAILED`, with the
underlying error detail (see [Result variants](#the-primitives)).

† Address-balance gas (an empty payment) is how the sponsor pays from its own balance rather than
from nominated gas coins; the sponsor-builds flow always sets this, so this validator mainly guards
user-supplied bytes.

‡ Verifies (via `@mysten/sui`'s `isValidTransactionSignature`) that **every** supplied user
signature is cryptographically valid over the bytes **and** resolves to the sender — caught before
the sponsor co-signs, rather than only at execution (all supplied signatures are attached to
execution, so one that isn't the sender's would be rejected on-chain after the sponsor signed). A
malformed, invalid, or wrong-signer signature is rejected as `USER_SIGNATURE_INVALID`; the sender
match is key-type aware (a zkLogin key matches either its legacy or current address). An
_environmental_ failure during verification (e.g. a zkLogin JWK/epoch lookup throwing) isn't a
validation result — it surfaces as `ANALYSIS_FAILED`, so a network blip is never reported as a bad
signature. Passes when no user signature was supplied (the sponsor-builds flow). The signature is
read from the request, not from `validationOptions`.

`defaults()` bundles `validSender()` + `onlyAddressBalanceGas()` + `gasCoinNotUsed()` +
`onlySenderWithdrawals()` + `simulationSucceeds()` + `boundedExpiration()` (see
[Defaults](#defaults)).

## Timing-attack mitigation

Optionally insert random delays to blunt TOCTOU / sandwich manipulation of on-chain state between
signing and execution:

```ts
createSponsor({
	signer,
	client,
	delay: {
		beforeSimulate: { min: 50, max: 200 }, // ms (or a fixed number) before the analysis is resolved
		beforeExecute: { min: 50, max: 200 }, // before executing
		// random: () => 0.5,                 // override the RNG (e.g. in tests)
	},
});
```

This is mitigation, not prevention. `beforeSimulate` runs once before the analysis resolves (where
simulation, if any, happens). Default is off.
