# Migrating to @mysten/sui@2.0

## ZkLogin Signature verification

In previous versions of the SDK, methods that verified ZkLogin signatures created a GraphQL client
that used the GraphQL alpha to verify mainnet ZkLogin signatures. This default is being removed, as
it was dependent on the GraphQL alpha endpoint, which is no longer available, and did not work for
non-mainnet signatures.

You will now need to pass a client (GraphQL, GRPC, or JSON RPC) to any methods that verify ZkLogin
signatures.

```ts
const client: SuiGraphQLClient | SuiGrpcClient | SuiJsonRpcClient;

verifyPersonalMessageSignature(message, signature, { client });
verifyTransactionSignature(txBytes, signature, { client });
parseSignature(signatureBytes, { client });

// For ZkLoginPublicIdentifier, the client is passed in when it it created
zkLoginPublicIdentifier = toZkLoginPublicIdentifier(seed, iss, { client, legacy: true });
zkLoginPublicIdentifier.verifyPersonalMessage(message, signature);
zkLoginPublicIdentifier.verifyTransaction(transaction, signature);
```

## Network is now required for GraphQL and JSON RPC clients

When creating a new `SuiGraphQLClient` or `SuiJsonRpcClient`, you must now provide a `network`
parameter.

```ts
const client = new SuiGraphQLClient({
	url: 'https://...',
	network: 'mainnet', // or 'testnet', 'devnet', etc.
});
const client = new SuiJsonRpcClient({
	url: 'https://...',
	network: 'mainnet', // or 'testnet', 'devnet', etc.
});
```
