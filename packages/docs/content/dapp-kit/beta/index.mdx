## Using Web Components for UI

The dApp Kit provides Web Components that work with any framework. These components are built
with Lit Element and can be used directly in your HTML:

```html
<!-- Connect Button Component -->
<mysten-dapp-kit-connect-button></mysten-dapp-kit-connect-button>

<!-- Connect Modal Component -->
<mysten-dapp-kit-connect-modal></mysten-dapp-kit-connect-modal>
```
