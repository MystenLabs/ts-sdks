The Sui dApp Kit provides tools and components for building decentralized applications on the Sui

data, and manage application state.

## Available Versions

Two versions of the dApp Kit are available:

### [dApp Kit (Beta)](./dapp-kit/beta)

- Framework-agnostic core that works with vanilla JS, React, Vue, or any framework
- Action-based API for direct wallet operations
- Web Components for universal UI elements
- Automatic state management with nanostores
- Smaller bundle size and improved performance
- Separate React bindings

### [dApp Kit (Legacy)](./dapp-kit/current)

The original React-focused version of the dApp Kit. This toolkit provides:

- React hooks for wallet connection and blockchain queries
- Pre-built UI components with Radix UI
- Integration with TanStack React Query
- Comprehensive wallet state management

The beta version is recommended for new projects, while the legacy version remains stable and
production-ready for existing applications.
