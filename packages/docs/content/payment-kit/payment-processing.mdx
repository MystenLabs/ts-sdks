Payment Kit provides two distinct payment processing models, each designed for different use cases.
This guide explains how each model works and when to use them.

## Payment Models Overview

### Registry-Based Payments

Registry-based payments create a persistent `PaymentRecord` stored on-chain in a `PaymentRegistry`.
This model provides:

- **Duplicate Prevention**: A payment with the same parameters can only be processed once
- **Verifiable Proof**: On-chain proof that a payment was made
- **Expiration Management**: Records can be deleted after a configurable period
- **Centralized Tracking**: All payments are indexed under a specific registry

**When to Use:**

- E-commerce checkouts
- Subscription payments
- Invoice payments
- Any scenario requiring duplicate prevention

### Ephemeral Payments

Ephemeral payments process transfers without creating persistent on-chain records. This model
provides:

- **Lower Gas Costs**: No on-chain storage means cheaper transactions
- **Flexibility**: No registry configuration required

**When to Use:**

- Tipping/donations
- Recurring payments with external tracking
- High-frequency microtransactions
- Scenarios where duplicate prevention is handled off-chain

## How Payment Keys Work

Payment Kit uses a composite key system to uniquely identify payments. Understanding this is crucial
for using the SDK effectively.

### Payment Key Components

A payment key is derived from four parameters:

```ts
type PaymentKeyArgs = {
	nonce: string; // Unique identifier you provide
	amount: number; // Payment amount in smallest unit
	receiver: string; // Recipient address
	coinType: string; // Coin type being transferred
};
```

### Key Generation

When you process a registry payment, Payment Kit hashes these parameters to create a unique key:

```ts
// These parameters create a unique payment key
const paymentParams = {
	nonce: 'b5e88aec-d88e-4961-9204-6c84e0e1de4e',
	amount: 1000000000,
	receiver,
	coinType: '0x2::sui::SUI',
};

// If you try to process the same payment twice, it will fail
const tx1 = client.paymentKit.tx.processRegistryPayment({
	...paymentParams,
	sender: senderAddress,
	registryName: 'my-registry',
});

// This will fail - same payment key
const tx2 = client.paymentKit.tx.processRegistryPayment({
	...paymentParams,
	sender: senderAddress,
	registryName: 'my-registry',
});
```

### Changing Any Component Creates a New Key

Each component affects the payment key. Changing any parameter creates a different payment:

```ts
// Original payment
const originalNonce = crypto.randomUUID();

const payment1 = {
	nonce: originalNonce,
	amount: 1000000000,
	receiver,
	coinType: '0x2::sui::SUI',
};

// Different nonce = different payment
const payment2 = {
	nonce: crypto.randomUUID(), // Changed
	amount: 1000000000,
	receiver,
	coinType: '0x2::sui::SUI',
};

// Different amount = different payment
const payment3 = {
	nonce: originalNonce,
	amount: 2000000000, // Changed
	receiver,
	coinType: '0x2::sui::SUI',
};

// All three are unique payments that can be processed separately
```

## Processing Registry-Based Payments

Let's walk through a complete registry payment workflow:

### Step 1: Create the Transaction

```ts
// Define your payment parameters
const paymentParams = {
	nonce: crypto.randomUUID(), // Your unique payment ID
	coinType: '0x2::sui::SUI', // SUI token
	amount: 1000000000, // 1 SUI (in MIST)
	receiver,
	sender: senderAddress, // Must match signer
};

// Create the transaction
const tx = client.paymentKit.tx.processRegistryPayment(paymentParams);
```

### What Happens On-Chain

When this transaction executes, Payment Kit:

1. **Validates** the payment parameters
2. **Checks** if a payment with this key already exists in the registry
3. **Transfers** the coins from sender to receiver
4. **Creates** a `PaymentRecord` dynamic field on the registry
5. **Emits** a `PaymentReceipt` event

### Step 2: Execute the Transaction

```ts
const result = await client.signAndExecuteTransaction({
	transaction: tx,
	signer: keypair,
	options: {
		showEffects: true,
		showEvents: true,
		showObjectChanges: true,
	},
});

console.log('Transaction digest:', result.digest);
```

### Step 3: Extract the Receipt

```ts
// Find the PaymentReceipt event
const receiptEvent = result.events?.find((event) => event.type.includes('PaymentReceipt'));

if (receiptEvent) {
	const receipt = receiptEvent.parsedJson;

	console.log('Payment Receipt:');
	console.log('  Type:', receipt.payment_type); // 'Registry'
	console.log('  Nonce:', receipt.nonce); // 'crypto.randomUUID()'
	console.log('  Amount:', receipt.amount); // 1n * MIST_PER_SUI
	console.log('  Receiver:', receipt.receiver); //
	console.log('  Coin Type:', receipt.coin_type); // '0x2::sui::SUI'
	console.log('  Timestamp:', receipt.timestamp_ms); // Unix timestamp
}
```

### Step 4: Verify the Payment Record

```ts
// Query the payment record to confirm it exists
const record = await client.paymentKit.getPaymentRecord({
	nonce: crypto.randomUUID(),
	coinType: '0x2::sui::SUI',
	amount: 1000000000,
	receiver,
});

if (record) {
	console.log('Payment verified!');
	console.log('Record ID:', record.key);
	console.log('Transaction:', record.paymentTransactionDigest);
	console.log('Epoch:', record.epochAtTimeOfRecord);
}
```

## Processing Ephemeral Payments

Ephemeral payments follow a simpler flow without creating persistent records:

### Creating an Ephemeral Payment

```ts
// No registry needed for ephemeral payments
const tx = client.paymentKit.tx.processEphemeralPayment({
	nonce: crypto.randomUUID(),
	coinType: '0x2::sui::SUI',
	amount: 500000000, // 0.5 SUI
	receiver,
	sender: senderAddress,
});

const result = await client.signAndExecuteTransaction({
	transaction: tx,
	signer: keypair,
	options: {
		showEvents: true,
	},
});
```

### What Happens On-Chain

For ephemeral payments, Payment Kit:

1. **Validates** the payment parameters
2. **Transfers** the coins from sender to receiver
3. **Emits** a `PaymentReceipt` event

**Note:** No `PaymentRecord` is created, so duplicate payments are not prevented.

### Extracting the Receipt

```ts
const receiptEvent = result.events?.find((event) => event.type.includes('PaymentReceipt'));

if (receiptEvent) {
	const receipt = receiptEvent.parsedJson;
	console.log('Payment Type:', receipt.payment_type); // 'Ephemeral'
}
```

## Advanced Payment Scenarios

### Processing Multiple Payments in One Transaction

You can combine multiple payment operations in a single transaction:

```ts
import { Transaction } from '@mysten/sui/transactions';

const tx = new Transaction();

// Add multiple registry payments
tx.add(
	client.paymentKit.calls.processRegistryPayment({
		nonce: crypto.randomUUID(),
		coinType: '0x2::sui::SUI',
		amount: 1000000000,
		receiver,
		sender: senderAddress,
	}),
);

tx.add(
	client.paymentKit.calls.processRegistryPayment({
		nonce: crypto.randomUUID(),
		coinType: '0x2::sui::SUI',
		amount: 2000000000,
		receiver,
		sender: senderAddress,
	}),
);

// Execute all payments in one transaction
const result = await client.signAndExecuteTransaction({
	transaction: tx,
	signer: keypair,
});
```

### Working with Custom Coin Types

Payment Kit works with any Sui coin type:

```ts
// Example with a custom token
const CUSTOM_COIN = '0xabc123::my_token::MY_TOKEN';

const tx = client.paymentKit.tx.processRegistryPayment({
	nonce: crypto.randomUUID(),
	coinType: CUSTOM_COIN,
	amount: 1000, // Amount in the coin's smallest unit
	receiver,
	sender: senderAddress,
});

// Make sure the sender has enough of the custom coin
const result = await client.signAndExecuteTransaction({
	transaction: tx,
	signer: keypair,
});
```

## Gas Considerations

### Registry Payments

Registry payments have higher gas costs because they:

- Create a new dynamic field (first payment with unique key)
- Write data to the registry object
- Perform duplicate checking

### Ephemeral Payments

Ephemeral payments have lower gas costs because they:

- Only transfer coins
- Don't create persistent storage
- Skip duplicate checking

## Best Practices

1. **Use Meaningful Nonces**: Choose nonces that help you track payments (e.g., `order-123`,
   `invoice-456`)

2. **Store Receipts Off-Chain**: Save `PaymentReceipt` events in your database for quick lookup

3. **Handle Duplicate Attempts**: Gracefully handle duplicate payment attempts with proper error
   messages

4. **Verify Before Delivery**: Always verify payment records before delivering goods/services

5. **Choose the Right Model**:
   - Use registry payments for critical transactions requiring duplicate prevention
   - Use ephemeral payments for high-frequency, low-value transactions

6. **Monitor Expiration**: If using registry payments, be aware of the expiration policy and query
   records before they expire
