The `switchAccount` action changes the currently selected account to a different account from the
connected wallet.

	Account switching is integrated into the [Connect Button](../web-components/connect-button) Web
	Component. When a wallet is connected with multiple accounts, the button provides an account
	selector.
</Callout>

## Usage

import { createDAppKit } from '@mysten/dapp-kit-core';

const dAppKit = createDAppKit({
	/* config */
});

// Switch to a different account
dAppKit.switchAccount({
	account: anotherAccount, // UiWalletAccount from the connected wallet
});
```

## Parameters

- **`account`** - `UiWalletAccount` - The account to switch to. Must be an account that belongs to
  the currently connected wallet.

## Return Value

Returns `void`. The action completes synchronously and updates the connection state immediately.
