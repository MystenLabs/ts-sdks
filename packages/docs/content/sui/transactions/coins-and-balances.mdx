title: Coins and Balances
---

Tokens are the most common thing you work with in transactions. Sui has two systems for holding
fungible token balances: **coin objects** and **address balances**. Understanding both is important
for building reliable transactions.

<Callout type="warning">
	Address balances are currently only available on devnet and testnet. They are not yet supported on
	mainnet.
</Callout>

## Coin objects vs address balances

**Coin objects** are individual on-chain objects, each with its own ID, version, and balance. You
own specific coin objects and need to split, merge, and track them.

**Address balances** are an accumulator per address per coin type. There are no objects to manage —
deposits automatically merge into a single balance, and you withdraw from it as needed.

Both systems coexist. An address's total balance for a given coin type is the sum of its coin object
balances and its address balance.

## Checking balances

Use `getBalance` to see the full picture (see [client docs](/sui/clients) for setup):

```typescript
import { SuiGrpcClient } from '@mysten/sui/grpc';

const grpcClient = new SuiGrpcClient({
	network: 'mainnet',
	baseUrl: 'https://fullnode.mainnet.sui.io:443',
});

const { balance } = await grpcClient.getBalance({
	owner: '0xMyAddress',
});

console.log(balance.coinType); // '0x2::sui::SUI'
console.log(balance.balance); // total balance (coin objects + address balance)
console.log(balance.coinBalance); // balance from coin objects only
console.log(balance.addressBalance); // balance from address balance only
```

For a specific token type:

```typescript
const { balance } = await grpcClient.getBalance({
	owner: '0xMyAddress',
	coinType: '0xPackageId::module::CoinType',
});
```

## Using coinWithBalance (recommended)

`coinWithBalance` is the recommended way to get a coin of any type in a transaction. It
automatically draws from both coin objects and address balances:

```typescript
import { coinWithBalance, Transaction } from '@mysten/sui/transactions';

const tx = new Transaction();

// SUI (balance is in MIST — 1 SUI = 1,000,000,000 MIST)
tx.transferObjects([coinWithBalance({ balance: 1_000_000_000 })], '0xRecipientAddress');

// Another coin type
tx.transferObjects(
	[coinWithBalance({ balance: 1_000_000, type: '0xPackageId::module::CoinType' })],
	'0xRecipientAddress',
);
```

Under the hood, `coinWithBalance` looks up the sender's coins, finds enough to cover the requested
balance, merges them if needed, and splits off the exact amount. You don't need to manage any of
this yourself.

To force `coinWithBalance` to use only address balance withdrawals (skipping coin object lookups),
set `forceAddressBalance: true`. This is useful for [offline transaction building](./offline):

```typescript
tx.transferObjects(
	[coinWithBalance({ balance: 1_000_000_000, forceAddressBalance: true })],
	'0xRecipientAddress',
);
```

### Getting a Balance from coinWithBalance

Some Move functions expect a `Balance<T>` instead of a `Coin<T>`. Use `0x2::coin::into_balance` to
convert the coin:

```typescript
import { coinWithBalance, Transaction } from '@mysten/sui/transactions';

const tx = new Transaction();

const [balance] = tx.moveCall({
	target: '0x2::coin::into_balance',
	typeArguments: ['0x2::sui::SUI'],
	arguments: [coinWithBalance({ balance: 1_000_000_000 })],
});

// Use the Balance<T> in a Move call that expects it
tx.moveCall({
	target: '0xPackage::module::deposit',
	arguments: [tx.object('0xPoolId'), balance],
});
```

## Sending to address balances

To deposit tokens directly into a recipient's address balance (instead of creating a new coin object
for them), use `0x2::coin::send_funds`:

```typescript
import { coinWithBalance, Transaction } from '@mysten/sui/transactions';

const tx = new Transaction();

tx.moveCall({
	target: '0x2::coin::send_funds',
	typeArguments: ['0x2::sui::SUI'],
	arguments: [coinWithBalance({ balance: 1_000_000_000 }), tx.pure.address('0xRecipientAddress')],
});
```

This avoids creating a new coin object for the recipient. The funds go directly into their address
balance accumulator.

## Manual coin operations

For fine-grained control, you can split and merge coins manually.

### Splitting coins

`splitCoins` creates new coins from an existing coin:

```typescript
const tx = new Transaction();

// Split specific amounts from a coin you own
const [coin1, coin2] = tx.splitCoins('0xMyCoinId', [1_000_000, 2_000_000]);

tx.transferObjects([coin1], '0xAlice');
tx.transferObjects([coin2], '0xBob');
```

You can also split the gas coin for SUI:

```typescript
const [coin] = tx.splitCoins(tx.gas, [1_000_000_000]);
tx.transferObjects([coin], '0xRecipientAddress');
```

<Callout type="warn">
	`tx.gas` does not work with address balances. If your SUI is held in address balances rather than
	coin objects, use `coinWithBalance` instead.
</Callout>

### Merging coins

`mergeCoins` combines multiple coins into one. Source coins can be object IDs, `tx.object()`
references, `coinWithBalance` results, or results from other commands:

```typescript
import { coinWithBalance, Transaction } from '@mysten/sui/transactions';

const tx = new Transaction();

// Merge by object ID
tx.mergeCoins('0xCoin1', ['0xCoin2', '0xCoin3']);

// Merge a coinWithBalance result into an existing coin
tx.mergeCoins(tx.object('0xCoin1'), [coinWithBalance({ balance: 500_000 })]);

// Merge a coin returned from a Move call
const [mintedCoin] = tx.moveCall({ target: '0xPackage::token::mint' });
tx.mergeCoins(tx.object('0xCoin1'), [mintedCoin]);
```

## Working with address balances directly

### Withdrawing from address balance

`tx.withdrawal()` creates a `Withdrawal<Balance<T>>` input that draws from your address balance.
This is a withdrawal capability — to get a usable value, you must redeem it.

To get a `Coin<T>` (for transfers and most operations):

```typescript
const tx = new Transaction();

const [coin] = tx.moveCall({
	target: '0x2::coin::redeem_funds',
	typeArguments: ['0x2::sui::SUI'],
	arguments: [tx.withdrawal({ amount: 1_000_000_000 })],
});

tx.transferObjects([coin], '0xRecipientAddress');
```

To get a `Balance<T>` (for Move functions that expect a balance directly):

```typescript
const [balance] = tx.moveCall({
	target: '0x2::balance::redeem_funds',
	typeArguments: ['0x2::sui::SUI'],
	arguments: [tx.withdrawal({ amount: 1_000_000_000 })],
});

// Use the Balance<T> in a Move call
tx.moveCall({
	target: '0xPackage::module::deposit',
	arguments: [tx.object('0xPoolId'), balance],
});
```

For non-SUI coin types, pass the `type` parameter:

```typescript
const withdrawal = tx.withdrawal({
	amount: 1_000_000,
	type: '0xPackageId::module::CoinType',
});
```

### Depositing coins into address balances

Use `0x2::coin::send_funds` to deposit a coin into a recipient's address balance. The coin object is
consumed and the funds are added to the address balance accumulator:

```typescript
const tx = new Transaction();

tx.moveCall({
	target: '0x2::coin::send_funds',
	typeArguments: ['0x2::sui::SUI'],
	arguments: [tx.object('0xMyCoinObjectId'), tx.pure.address('0xRecipientAddress')],
});
```

You can also deposit into your own address balance to consolidate coin objects:

```typescript
tx.moveCall({
	target: '0x2::coin::send_funds',
	typeArguments: ['0x2::sui::SUI'],
	arguments: [
		tx.object('0xMyCoinObjectId'),
		tx.pure.address('0xMyAddress'), // send to yourself
	],
});
```

### Converting coins to Balance objects

`Balance<T>` is a Move struct that holds a fungible token amount without being a standalone object.
It's commonly used inside shared objects (like liquidity pools) to store funds. Use
`0x2::coin::into_balance` to convert a coin:

```typescript
const tx = new Transaction();

const [balance] = tx.moveCall({
	target: '0x2::coin::into_balance',
	typeArguments: ['0x2::sui::SUI'],
	arguments: [tx.object('0xMyCoinId')],
});

// Store the balance in a shared object
tx.moveCall({
	target: '0xPackage::pool::add_liquidity',
	arguments: [tx.object('0xPoolId'), balance],
});
```

To convert a `Balance<T>` back into a `Coin<T>`:

```typescript
const [coin] = tx.moveCall({
	target: '0x2::coin::from_balance',
	typeArguments: ['0x2::sui::SUI'],
	arguments: [balance],
});
```

<Callout type="info">
	`Balance<T>` values cannot be transferred between addresses — they must be stored inside objects
	or converted to `Coin<T>` first. Use `send_funds` to deposit directly into an address balance, or
	`into_balance` / `from_balance` for conversions within a transaction.
</Callout>

## Listing coin objects

When you need to see specific coin objects (not just aggregate balances), use `listCoins`:

```typescript
const { objects, hasNextPage, cursor } = await grpcClient.listCoins({
	owner: '0xMyAddress',
});

for (const coin of objects) {
	console.log(coin.objectId, coin.balance);
}

// For a specific type
const { objects: usdcCoins } = await grpcClient.listCoins({
	owner: '0xMyAddress',
	coinType: '0xPackageId::module::USDC',
});
```

Each coin object includes `objectId`, `version`, `digest`, `balance`, and `type`.
